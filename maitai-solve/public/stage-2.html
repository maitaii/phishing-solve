            * The admin will land on the challenge page, because Chrome will prefer the local address over the remote one. (?)
            * Last minute change, the aformentioned statement is not correct. Apparently is random.
            * Maybe since there are some DNS caching magic happening we can try to saturate the cache with random fetch in order to make the exploit more reliable.
            * The request to /moderator/logs will make the server crash. The browser will then perform the request to the other address as fallback.
            * On the other address there will be the third stage.
